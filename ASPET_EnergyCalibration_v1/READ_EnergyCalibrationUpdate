#This program will read the spectrum of each channel, pick up the highest and clearest energy peak and estimate the deviation from the calibration file in keV

# The program also displays the energy spectra of all channel and the corresponding peak pickup and fitting

#To execute the program; there are examples below with 6 arguments

argv[1]: The measurement of the investigated date (BG or PAG 511 keV spectra): .bin file

argv[2]: the original energy calibration file

argv[3-4]: boundary in ToT of the energy spectra

argv[5-6]: peak finding parameters for the spectrum

argv[7]: The known dominating gamma line in the measurement spectrum

#The program will create folders: CalUpdate ; CalUpdate/Spectrum
